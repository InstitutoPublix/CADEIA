Foreword

This fifth edition of OECD Competition Trends presents unique insights into global competition trends
based on data from 77 OECD and non-OECD jurisdictions. It analyses multi-year data on a large number
of economic and legal indicators in the OECD CompStats database with a focus on the main developments
in 2022. In doing so, OECD Competition Trends 2024 supports informed policy making and contributes to
improving competition law and policy around the world.
The OECD Competition Committee, which includes representatives of the world’s major competition
authorities, is the premier source of policy analysis and advice to governments on how best to harness
market forces in the interests of greater global economic efficiency and prosperity. For over 60 years, the
OECD and its Competition Committee have taken a leading role in shaping the framework for international
co-operation among competition agencies. The resulting recommendations, best practices and policy
roundtables serve both as models and inspiration for national initiatives and as tools for sharing global best
practices on competition law and policy. Competition officials from developed and emerging economies
are offered a unique platform from which to monitor developments in competition policy and enforcement,
and to discuss new solutions for increasing effectiveness.
The OECD CompStats database is the result of an initiative launched in 2018. The database compiles
general statistics relating to competition agencies, including data on enforcement and resources and
information on advocacy initiatives. The data are collected annually and currently covers the period
2015-22. The data are mainly presented at an aggregate level, combining the data of individual
jurisdictions. The aggregate-level analyses focus on (i) all participating jurisdictions (“All jurisdictions”),
(ii) two groups consisting of OECD and non-OECD jurisdictions, and (iii) four geographic regions
(Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Middle East and Africa (MEA)). This year, participating jurisdictions
have agreed to make public their data pertaining to merger control. Therefore, the data in that section is
not only presented on an aggregated basis. The objective is not to rank jurisdictions, which is not possible
given the specificities of their merger regimes, however it does allow to better understand the data and
address jurisdiction-specific phenomena.
In this year’s report, some numbers from earlier years may differ from previous versions of the OECD
Competition Trends series for several reasons, including: (i) Costa Rica has been included this year in
OECD averages as it became an OECD Member on May 2021, making 2022 its first full year as a Member;
(ii) some jurisdictions provided information that was not available in previous years; and (iii) some
jurisdictions provided revised statistics for some variables.
As the role and scope of competition law and policy continue to evolve, the tools of competition authorities
must constantly develop and incorporate lessons learned from others. This publication contributes to
helping policy makers and competition enforcers to stay up to date with the different ways in which
competition law and policy is applied throughout the world.
The publication was prepared by the OECD Competition Division, in particular a team composed of Wouter
Meester, project leader; Daniel Westrik; Aura García Pabón; Manuela Sánchez and Alberto Gómez, all of
the OECD Competition Division. The report benefited from comments and suggestions by Ori Schwartz
and Antonio Capobianco, respectively Head and Deputy Head of the OECD Competition Division. The
report was prepared for publication by Erica Agostinho. The authors thank the individual competition
authorities in the participating jurisdictions who provided the information on which much of this publication
is based.

Executive summary


This report focuses on the main developments in global competition enforcement in 2022. The OECD
CompStats database currently includes eight years of data from 77 jurisdictions. An Excel file with a
complete set of graphs covering all competition enforcement indicators, i.e. all indicators on all years
(2015-22), can be found on the OECD Competition Trends publication website.
The report consists of three chapters. Chapter 1 provides a brief overview of competition enforcement in
the participating jurisdictions. Chapter 2 describes the main developments in 2022 compared to 2021, for
resources, cartel and abuse of dominance enforcement, and advocacy. Chapter 3 presents a more
detailed (in-focus) analysis of merger control data and trends, including a review of all merger prohibitions
between 2015-22.


Key developments in 2022

This section covers the key developments in 2022 for resources, cartel enforcement, abuse of dominance
enforcement, and advocacy. Merger control is covered in a subsequent standalone chapter.

Resources

Competition staff continued growing – There was continued growth in the number of competition staff
in 2022, although the growth was lower than in 2021. The average number of competition staff per
competition authority was 130 in 2022, up from 125 in 2021, and considerably higher than 118 in 2020.
There was an increase in every region except Asia-Pacific. The average number of competition staff
increased in every year from 2015 to 2022.
Nominal competition budget increased but real budget decreased – Average nominal competition
budget increased in all regions except Asia-Pacific. The highest increase (18.1% compared to 2021) was
seen by non-OECD jurisdictions, mostly driven by two of them. However, average real competition budget
decreased in all regions. This suggests that the significant increase in annual growth rate for nominal
competition budget (10%) in 2022 across all jurisdictions, was predominantly due to inflation, as it was
negative at -2.6% for real competition budget.

Cartel enforcement

Leniency applications increased in all regions for the first time since 2015 – For the first time since
2015, when the OECD began collecting the Competition Statistics data, the total number of leniency
applications increased in all regions, reversing the previous downward trend. The total number of leniency
applications increased from 201 in 2021 to 248 in 2022, an annual growth rate of 23.4%. The resurgence
began in 2021 in Europe, continuing in 2022, and accompanied by an increase in all regions.

Cartel ex-officio investigations increased by 19.3% – Average cartel ex-officio cartel investigations
increased to 8.4 in 2022 (representing an annual growth of 19.3%), countering the steady decline from
14.7 in 2016 to 7.1 in 2021.
Cartel dawn raids remained stable – The average number of cartel dawn raids remained stable in 2022
(with an average across all jurisdictions of 3.6 in 2022, identical to 2021), slightly increasing in the Americas
and Europe, while decreasing in Asia-Pacific and MEA. In all regions, we had witnessed a significant
decline in 2020, mostly resulting from the Covid-19 lockdowns.
Cartel decisions decreased, mostly in Europe – In 2022, there was a decline in the average number of
cartel decisions in Europe and MEA but an increase in Americas and Asia-Pacific. The average across all
jurisdictions fell from 6.8 in 2021 to 6.3 in 2022. The biggest decline was in Non-OECD European
jurisdictions, where the annual decrease on cartel decisions was around 41%. Two possible explanations
for the decline in cartel decisions include the decrease in ex-officio investigations between 2016 and 2021
(including decrease in investigations due to covid during 2020-21) and the consistent decline in leniency
applications since 2015.
Cartel bid-rigging decisions increased by 9.7% – There was an increase in bid-rigging cases between
2021 and 2022 (the only two years for which OECD CompStats data for bid-rigging decisions exist), namely
from 154 to 169. The average number of bid-rigging decisions across all jurisdictions increased by 9.7%
in 2022. As a percentage of all cartel decisions, bid-rigging decisions across all jurisdictions increased from
32% in 2021 to 38% in 2022, although there were some regional differences. In 2022, the region where
bid-rigging decisions represented the highest percentage of cartel decisions was MEA (40%).
The industries with the most cartel decisions in 2022 were manufacturing, construction and
wholesale trade – The top 10 industries based on the total number of cartel decisions remained relatively
similar to the ranking in 2021. “Manufacturing”, “Construction” and “Wholesale Trade” were still the three
industries with the most cartel decisions in 2022. However, they only represented 44% of all cartel
decisions in 2022, down from 48% in 2021. “Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting” was the industry
where the number of cases grew the most, representing 7% of the cases in 2022 (up from only 2.4% in
2021).
Cartel settlements decreased, notably in MEA – The average number of cartel cases with settlements
was relatively stable in 2022, albeit with regional differences. Notably, in MEA, the average cartel cases
closed with settlements decreased from 4.3 to 2.9.

Abuse of dominance enforcement

Abuse of dominance investigations declined in 50 jurisdictions – The average number of abuse of
dominance investigations launched by competition authorities declined in all regions, except MEA. In 82%
(50 out of the 63 jurisdictions with relevant data for all years), the number of investigations declined or
remained unchanged. The average number of investigations launched was down from 5.6 in 2021 to 4.2
in 2022 across all jurisdictions, a decline of around 25%.
Abuse of dominance decisions kept their downward trend – The average number of abuse of
dominance decisions per jurisdiction declined slightly overall, from 2 in 2021 to 1.5 in 2022. This continues
a slow downward trend over the period, from an average of 2.4 abuse of dominance decisions per
jurisdiction in 2015 to 1.5 in 2022. Despite the increase observed in 2021, there was a significant decrease
in the number of abuse of dominance decisions in both OECD and non-OECD jurisdictions, reverting to
2020 levels.
The industries whith the most abuse of dominance decisions in 2020 were manufacturing,
transportation and wharehousing, and information – The top 10 industries based on the total number
of abuse of dominance decisions in 2022 was similar to 2021. “Manufacturing”, “Transportation and

Warehousing” and “Information” remained in the top three industries with the highest number of abuse of
dominance decisions in 2022, representing 47% of total decisions.
Abuse of dominance settlements and commitments declined notably in Americas – The average
number of abuse of dominance cases in which settlements, plea bargain procedures, commitment
procedures, or other types of negotiated/consensual procedures for settling infringement cases were used
slightly declined in 2022, however this was mostly driven by the Americas, while in other regions such as
Europe and MEA, their use increased.

Sanctions

Fines imposed by competition authorities decreased in 2022 – Fines for both cartels and abuse of
dominance cases declined in 2022. The average abuse of dominance fine imposed per jurisdiction
declined 52% from 42.5 million euros in 2021 to 20.4 million euros in 2022. The average cartel fine imposed
per jurisdiction decreased 45% from 89.8 million euros in 2021 to 49.5 million euros in 2022.

Advocacy

Market studies increased in Asia-Pacific – The average number of market studies per jurisdiction was
relatively stable in all regions, except Asia-Pacific where it increased considerably (from 3.2 in 2021 to 5.4
in 2022).


In focus: trends in merger control

Each edition of OECD Competition Trends includes a chapter that addresses a certain topic in more detail.
This year’s edition focuses on merger control.
Merger notifications dropped in 2022 – In 2022, there was a drop in the number of overall merger
notifications predominantly driven by a decline in OECD jurisdictions. The number of merger notifications
in non-OECD jurisdictions continued to increase in 2022, although at a slower rate than in 2021.
Merger intervention rate increased significantly in OECD jurisdictions – Contrary to 2021, there was
a significant increase in the merger intervention rate – the proportion of transactions in which competition
authorities intervened, either by imposing a remedy or by prohibiting a transaction – in 2022. Most of this
increase was driven by OECD jurisdictions, while there was a slight decline for non-OECD jurisdictions.
Competition authorities approved more mergers with remedies – The rising overall intervention rate
in 2022 has been mostly driven by an increase in the use of remedies (which increased by more than
55%), rather than prohibitions and withdrawn mergers which remained relatively stable.
Prohibitions are concentrated in a few jurisdictions –The five jurisdictions with the most prohibitions
represent 54% of all prohibitions during the period 2015 to 2022 (116 of 216 prohibitions). This includes
South Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Israel and the European Union.
Horizontal theories of harm are the most common in prohibition decisions – Horizontal theories of
harm make up the vast majority in merger prohibition decisions. Most are horizontal unilateral theories of
harm, while horizontal coordinated theories of harm are similar in amount to vertical theories of harm.
Conglomerate and public interest theories of harm are negligible in merger prohibition decisions.
The industries with most prohibitions between 2015-22 were manufacturing, retail trade, and
transportation and warehousing – Prohibitions are more common in industries that are typically
characterised by homogenous products and where there may be more likely issues related to a horizontal
overlap, such as manufacturing, retail trade and transportation and warehousing.

jurisdictions for competition staff, 68 jurisdictions for cartel decisions, 68 jurisdictions for abuse of dominance decisions, and 66 jurisdictions for
merger decisions). Nominal competition budget figures are in 2015 euros (non-euro currencies are converted using 2015 official exchange rates on
31 December 2015) to eliminate distortions due to currency fluctuations. The growth on nominal budget for non-OECD jurisdictions was mostly
driven by two of them. Competition staff are staff working only on competition (excluding administrative staff or staff involved in other functions of the
authority, such as consumer protection, public procurement, sector regulation).

  2 Key developments in 2022


             This chapter highlights the main global competition enforcement
             developments in 2022. It contextualises them among the broader trend over
             time, where relevant. It includes the most significant changes in variables
             such as resources, cartel enforcement, abuse of dominance enforcement,
             and advocacy. Merger control has a dedicated chapter that follows this one,
             and thus does not feature here.

As for last year’s OECD Competition Trends report, this edition focuses on the main annual developments,
that is, the key changes in 2022 relative to 2021.


Resources

Competition staff continued to grow

The sustained growth in competition staff at authorities around the world continued in 2022, with an overall
annual growth rate of 3.8% (although this was around half the annual growth rate of 6% in 2021). The
average number of competition staff per agency increased from 125 in 2021 to 130 in 2022, considerably
higher than the average of 118 in 2020. There was an increase in every region except Asia-Pacific. The
average number of competition staff increased in every year from 2015 to 2022, except in 2020 where it
remained the same as in the previous year. The regional differences in staff levels are largely driven by
differences in the size of the jurisdictions.

Nominal competition budget increased, but real competition budget was flat

The average nominal competition budget increased in 2022 in all regions, except Asia-Pacific. Thus, there
was a decline in both competition staff and budget in Asia-Pacific in 2022.
However, average real competition budget decreased in all regions. 1 The significant increase in annual
growth rate for nominal competition budget (10% in 2022 across all jurisdictions) appears to be
predominantly driven by inflation, as the real growth was negative at -2.6%.
Particularly stark was the large increase in nominal budget in MEA jurisdictions in 2022 (52.7%), although
in real terms the average competition budget for the region decreased by 1.5%. While inflation was an
issue across the region, there was one single MEA jurisdiction that had particularly high inflation in 2022

and explained most of the large difference between nominal and real competition budget. A similar trend
can be observed in the Americas region. While the growth in the nominal competition budgets in the region
was of 11.5%, mostly driven by two jurisdictions, the average real competition budget decreased in 1.1%.
As it is the case with staff, the regional differences in budget levels are largely driven by differences in the
size of the jurisdictions.

Cartel enforcement

Cartel leniency applications increased, similar to cartel ex-officio investigations

For the first time since 2015, when the OECD began collecting the Competition Statistics data, cases with
leniency applications increased in all regions (from 10 cases with leniency applications in 2021 to 13 in
2022 in the Americas, 97 to 131 in Asia-Pacific, 86 to 92 in Europe, and 8 to 12 in MEA). The resurgence
began in 2021 in Europe, continuing in 2022, and was accompanied by an increase in all three other
regions. The total number of leniency applications increased from 201 in 2021 to 248 in 2022, an annual
growth rate of 23.4%.
Notwithstanding the promising development of increasing leniency applications across all regions, the
number of cases with applications remains significantly below levels in 2015 (more than 56% lower).
Moreover, the increase is quite concentrated in a few jurisdictions. Even though 24 jurisdictions (45% of
the 53 jurisdictions that provided data for this variable) saw an annual increase in leniency applications in
2022, four jurisdictions were responsible for most of the increase. One jurisdiction had an increase of 31
leniency applications in 2022, one an increase of 13, and two an increase of 7 leniency applications each.
Finally, 16 jurisdictions (30%) had no change, while 13 jurisdictions (25%) had a decline in leniency
applications.

Cartel decisions declined in Europe and MEA, but increased in Asia-Pacific and the
Americas

In 2022, there was a decline in the number of cartel decisions in Europe and MEA, while the average
number of decisions increased in Americas and Asia-Pacific. In Europe, the average number of cartel
decisions decreased to 3.8, even below the value of 4.1 in 2020, while the average has been relatively
stable around 5 decisions per jurisdiction over the period 2015 to 2021 (excluding 2020). In aggregate, this
meant there was a decline in the average number of cartel decisions across all jurisdictions to 6.3 in 2022
from 6.8 in 2021, as well as in OECD and non-OECD jurisdictions (with the biggest decline of -13.9% in
non-OECD jurisdictions, relative to only -3.7% in OECD jurisdictions).

Cartel bid-rigging decisions increased overall

There was an increase in bid-rigging cases across most jurisdictions between 2021 and 2022 (the only
two years for which OECD CompStats data exists). The average number of bid-rigging decisions across
all jurisdictions went from 2.2 in 2021 to 2.4 in 2022, an increase of 9.7%. As shown in Figure 2.8, bid-
rigging cartel decisions in MEA and Americas increased in 2022, while decisions decreased in Europe and
Asia-Pacific. The relative order of regions remained unchanged though, with Asia-Pacific having by far the
highest number of bid-rigging cartel decisions per jurisdiction and MEA steadily catching up.
As a percentage of all cartel decisions, bid-rigging decisions across all jurisdictions increased from 32% in
2021 to 38% in 2022. In the Americas, MEA and Europe, bid-rigging cartel decisions increased as a share
of all cartel decisions, although in Europe this is a reflection of the decrease in total cartel decisions.

Cartel decisions by industry: Manufacturing, Construction and Wholesale Trade were
still the industries with most cartel decisions

The top-10 industries based on the total number of cartel decisions remained relatively similar to the
ranking in 2021, although there were some changes in 2022. “Manufacturing”, “Construction” and
“Wholesale Trade” remained the three industries with the most cartel decisions in 2022. They represented
44% of all cartel decisions in 2022, down from 48% in 2021. The biggest percentage decline from these
three sectors was for “Wholesale Trade” with a decrease in participation of more than 40%.

Cartel settlements were relatively stable

The average number of cartel cases with settlements was relatively stable in 2022, albeit with regional
differences.
Across all jurisdictions, the number of cases in which settlements or plea bargain procedures for settling
cartel infringement cases were used stayed relatively steady around 1.8 per jurisdiction on average.
However, regional differences exist. The number of cases slightly increased in Asia-Pacific, while they
strongly decreased in in MEA (from 4.3 in 2021 to 2.9 in 2022) and were relatively stable in Europe and
the Americas.

Abuse of dominance enforcement

Abuse of dominance investigations launched declined considerably

The average number of abuse of dominance investigations launched by competition authorities declined
in all regions, except MEA. In 50 out of 63 jurisdictions with relevant data for all years, the number of
investigations launched declined or remained unchanged. The average number of investigations launched
was down from 5.6 in 2021 to 4.2 in 2022 across all jurisdictions, a decline of around 25%. While
investigations launched were relatively stable between 2017 and 2021, the overall trend since 2016 shows
a decline.

Abuse of dominance dawn raids increased in the Americas and MEA, but decreased in
Europe

The use of dawn raids for abuse of dominance cases remains fairly scarce. They increased in the Americas
and MEA (albeit from very low values, particularly in the Americas). Most abuse of dominance dawn raids
occur in MEA, where the average number per jurisdiction went from 0.5 in 2021 to 1.28 dawn raids in 2022,
even though it was driven by a single jurisdiction. In Europe, there was a considerable decline in 2022, all
driven by a few jurisdictions, although the movements tend to be quite erratic over the full period (2015-
22), and the average value of 0.56 per jurisdiction (across all jurisdictions in 2022) is low in any case. Of
the jurisdictions that provided data, most did not perform any dawn raids for abuse of dominance cases in
2022. In Asia-Pacific there have not been any abuse of dominance dawn raids since 2017.

Abuse of dominance decisions declined overall, continuing a broader trend since 2015

The average number of dominance decisions declined significantly, decreasing from 2 in 2021 to 1.5 in
2022. This continues a slow downward trend over the period, from an average of 2.4 abuse of dominance
decisions per jurisdiction in 2015 to 1.5 in 2022. For both OECD and non-OECD jurisdictions, the average
abuse of dominance decisions declined considerably in 2022 by 30% and 21%, respectively. This decrease
reverts the growth of abuse of dominance decisions in these regions witnessed between 2020 and 2021.

Manufacturing and Information were still the industries with the most abuse of
dominance decisions

The top 10 industries based on the total number of abuse of dominance decisions in 2022 was similar to
2021. “Transportation and Warehousing”, “Manufacturing” and “Information” remained the three industries
with the most abuse of dominance decisions in 2022. They represented 47% of all abuse of dominance
decisions in 2022, the same proportion as in 2021.

Abuse of dominance settlements and commitment decisions declined, mostly driven by
the Americas

Few abuse of dominance cases are solved by a way of a settlement or a commitment. In 2022, the use of
both figures further declined. The average number of abuse of dominance cases in which settlements or
plea bargain procedures for settling infringement cases were used slightly declined in 2022, although this
was mostly driven by the Americas and Asia-Pacific. In fact, in Asia-Pacific, no abuse of dominance cases
were settled in 2022. Their use increased somewhat in Europe and MEA, although their use of settlements
for abuse of dominance cases also remains limited (0.2 and 0.9, respectively).

Sanctions

Overall cartel and abuse of dominance fines decreased

Fines for both cartels and abuse of dominance cases declined in 2022. The average abuse of dominance
fines imposed per jurisdiction declined 52% from 42.5 million euros in 2021 to 20.4 million euros in 2022.
The average amount of cartel fines imposed per jurisdiction decreased 45% from 89.8 million euros in
2021 to 49.5 million euros in 2022. As in most years, there were more fines for cartel infringements than
abuse of dominance cases. The amount of fines imposed is erratic in most jurisdictions, without a clear
trend and can vary considerably from year to year, particularly for abuse of dominance fines (which peaked
in 2018). Cartel fines are more consistent over the period, with an average of around 82 million euros per
jurisdiction across the period 2015 to 2022.

relatively steady for cartels

The average number of companies fined per jurisdiction remained relatively steady at around 16 for cartels,
while it increased for abuse of dominance in 2022 (close to 2, which is the highest since 2015).

The number of cartel cases in which Individuals were fined was fairly low and
decreasing

The average number of cartel cases in which individuals were fined in cartel cases was fairly erratic when
considering given regions, however this averaged out over the period at around 2.9 cartel cases per
jurisdiction in which a fine was imposed on an individual.

Market studies increased in most regions

The average number of market studies per jurisdiction was relatively stable in all regions, except Asia-
Pacific where it increased considerably. In Asia-Pacific, the average per jurisdiction increased from 3.2 in
2021 to 5.4 in 2022 (growth of 65%) market studies per authority. However, this is mostly driven by a
handful of jurisdictions in the region. In general, the most relevant increase came from non-OECD
jurisdictions (where the average went from 2.1 to 2.7 studies per year), as in OECD jurisdiction the average
number remained the same (3 market studies per year).

  3 In focus: trends in merger control


             This chapter is dedicated to merger control, providing an analysis of: (i) the
             OECD CompStats merger data, which is now available publicly on an
             individualised basis, and thus can be explained in more detail than was
             previously possible; and (ii) a new dataset collected by the OECD Secretariat
             on all prohibition decisions over the period 2015 to 2022.

This year, for the first time, jurisdictions agreed to make public data on merger control on an individualised
basis. With this in mind, this chapter presents trends in merger control on an aggregate basis, but explains
which jurisdictions are driving these aggregate trends. Individualised merger control data can be found in
the Excel file supporting this years’ report.


Trends in CompStats merger control

Merger notifications declined in OECD jurisdictions

In 2022, there was a drop in the number of overall merger notifications. However, this was predominantly
driven by a decline specifically in OECD jurisdictions. The number of merger notifications in non-OECD
jurisdictions continued to increase in 2022, although at a slower rate than in 2021. Despite the decline in
overall merger notifications in 2022, they were still higher than at any point in the period 2015 to 2020 (with
an average of 179 per jurisdiction, which was above the previous peak of 154 in 2019).

As shown in Figure 3.2, the decline in merger notifications in 2022 was common across most OECD
jurisdictions with 63% of OECD jurisdictions (24 of 38 jurisdictions with relevant data for all years) observing
a reduction in merger notifications, while notifications decreased in 36% (10 of 38 jurisdictions with relevant
data for all years) of non-OECD jurisdictions. Furthermore, for jurisdictions that had positive percentage
growth in 2022, it was much higher in non-OECD jurisdictions with an average of 47%, compared to only
26% in OECD jurisdictions. It is important to note than in the case of Peru, the percentage change is due
to the extension of the merger control regime beyond the energy sector to all sectors of the economy.
The surge in merger notifications in 2021 was largely due to the significant increase in the US, from 1 580
merger notifications in 2020 to 3 413 merger notifications in 2021. However, in 2022, it decreased by 11%
to 3 029 (although this value was still 92% higher than the number of merger notifications in 2020).

When looking at the merger notifications by region, the decline is observed in all of them. In Europe, merger
notifications declined the most (12% compared to 2021), followed by the Americas (decline in 8%), MEA
(decline in 5%) and Asia-Pacific (decline in 3%).

Merger intervention rate increased in OECD jurisdictions

Contrary to the previous year, there was a significant increase in the merger intervention rate – the
proportion of transactions in which competition authorities intervened, either by imposing a remedy or by
prohibiting a transaction – in 2022. This holds true regardless of whether withdrawn mergers are included
in the numerator or not. Most of this increase was driven by OECD jurisdictions, while for non-OECD
jurisdictions it remained stable.
The increase in 2022 observed in OECD jurisdictions was driven by the United Kingdom (15% in 2021 to
53% in 2022), Iceland (7% in 2021 to 30% in 2022), Greece (0% in 2021 to 10% in 2022), New Zealand
(6% in 2021 to 13% in 2022) and Ireland (4% in 2021 to 10% in 2022).2
The downward decline in non-OECD jurisdictions between 2017 and 2021, was not driven by steady
decline in any particular jurisdictions. The variation over time in these jurisdictions was more erratic, varying
significantly from year to year. The merger intervention rate in non-OECD jurisdictions has been steadily
declining from a peak of 8.1% in 2017 to a low of 4.3% in 2022.
The merger intervention rate was also declining in OECD jurisdictions over the period 2018 to 2021,
however this trend was reversed in 2022, with a sharp increase. This increase in OECD jurisdictions was
due to both: (i) an increase in the absolute number of merger decisions where the authority has intervened
from 135 in 2021 to 173 in 2022 (i.e., increase in the numerator); and (ii) a decline in the number of overall
decisions from 10 243 in 2021 to 9 026 in 2022 (i.e., decrease in the denominator).

Regional differences in the evolution of the intervention rate exist. While it increased in Europe and MEA,
it decreased in Asia-Pacific and Americas. MEA jurisdictions had the highest intervention rate in 2022, with
an average of 7.3%, increasing from 5.9% in 2021. In Asia-Pacific, the intervention rate in 2022 was the
lowest, with an average of only 2.7%, decreasing from 3.4% in 2021. In Europe, the intervention rate
increased the most, from 2.8% in 2021 to 5.9% in 2022, while in the Americas, it decreased the most, from
4.5% in 2021 to 3.4% in 2022.

Merger remedies were more frequently used by authorities

As shown in Figure 3.6, the increase of intervention rate in 2022 was mainly due to an increase in the use
of remedies. This was both the use of remedies in phase II (increasing from 108 to 185) and in phase I
(from 61 to 78). Prohibitions and withdrawn mergers were relatively similar in 2022 (34 and 53,
respectively) compared to 2021 (29 and 49, respectively), meaning that they do not explain the increase
in the intervention rate.

Trends in OECD prohibitions data

Most merger prohibitions are concentrated in a few jurisdictions

The OECD Secretariat gathered the decisions of all merger prohibitions identified by competition
authorities in the Competition Statistics survey for the period 2015 to 2022. There were 216 prohibition
decisions in total.
Based on a review of available prohibition decisions, competition authority websites and annual reports on
the OECD website, the Secretariat created several additional variables, including: (i) theory of harm in
which the authorities based their decisions (which consists of horizontal unilateral effects, horizontal
coordinated effects, vertical effects, conglomerate effects and others); (ii) industry (based on the NAICS
classification); and (iii) market. This section of the report provides a summary of those variables.
Most prohibitions are concentrated in a few jurisdictions. The six jurisdictions with the most prohibitions
represent 57% of all prohibitions during the period 2015 to 2022 (124 of 216 prohibitions). They are South
Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Israel, Germany and the European Union.

Most prohibitions rely on horizontal theories of harm

Horizontal theories of harm make up the vast majority in merger prohibition decisions (173 decisions).
Horizontal coordinated theories of harm (36 decisions) are similar in amount to vertical theories of harm
(39 decisions). Conglomerate theories of harm are negligible in merger prohibition decisions (only 4
decisions). There are also some jurisdictions that have other theories of harm, such as public interest
theories of harm in South Africa (although these are not included in the figure below).
Several prohibitions considered multiple theories of harm in the decision, especially in cases where
horizontal unilateral effects were not the main concern. While only 20% of the mergers that were prohibited
as a result of horizontal unilateral concerns also considered another theory of harm, this proportion
increases significantly when looking at mergers prohibited for coordinated and vertical effects (56% and
59% of the cases, respectively). All prohibitions that considered conglomerate effects also included another
theory of harm.

The proportion of merger prohibition decisions between the various theories of harm has been relatively
consistent over time, despite some variation. For example, 2019 had a peak of prohibition decisions
considering vertical and conglomerate theories of harm.

Manufacturing and Retail Trade are industries with the most prohibitions

Prohibitions are more common in industries that are typically characterised by homogenous products and
where there may be more likely issues related to a horizontal overlap, such as manufacturing and retail
trade. However, there are also several prohibitions in the industry “information”, which could relate,
although imperfectly, to transactions in the digital markets.

Annex A. Sources of CompStats


In 2018, under the guidance of the Bureau of the Competition Committee, the OECD Secretariat launched
an initiative to develop a database of general statistics relating to competition agencies, including data on
enforcement and information on advocacy initiatives.
Some statistics related to competition authorities’ activities are already publicly available. However, this
information is often dispersed, lacks consistency across time and jurisdictions, and is currently not used
systematically to identify overall trends from which to draw policy lessons. This initiative fills this gap.
The OECD Secretariat collects data annually from: (i) competition authorities in OECD jurisdictions;
(ii) authorities in non-OECD jurisdictions that are Participants or Associates in the OECD Competition
Committee; and (iii) agencies in jurisdictions that are neither OECD member nor a participant or associate
in the OECD Competition Committee but have expressed an interest to join the database.


Jurisdictions

The OECD CompStats database currently covers data from competition agencies in 77 jurisdictions, of
which 38 jurisdictions are OECD jurisdictions (including the European Commission).3
There are four geographic regions used in the analysis: Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East
and Africa (MEA). The 77 jurisdictions in the OECD CompStats database are allocated to these geographic
regions as follows (jurisdictions with an asterisk (*) are considered as OECD members for the data
analysis):
   •   Americas (18): Argentina, Barbados, Brazil, Canada*, Chile*, Colombia*, Costa Rica*, Dominican
       Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico*, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and
       Tobago, United States*, and Uruguay.
   •   Asia-Pacific (15): Australia*, Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong (China), India,
       Indonesia, Japan*, Kazakhstan, Korea*, Malaysia, New Zealand*, Philippines, Singapore, Chinese
       Taipei, and Viet Nam.
   •   Europe (34): Albania, Austria*, Belgium*, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia*, Denmark*, European
       Commission*, Estonia, Finland*, France*, Germany*, Greece*, Hungary*, Iceland*, Ireland*, Italy*,
       Latvia*, Lithuania*, Luxembourg*, Malta, Montenegro, Netherlands*, Norway*, Poland*, Portugal*,
       Romania, Slovak Republic*, Slovenia*, Spain*, Sweden*, Switzerland*, Ukraine, and the
       United Kingdom*.
   •   MEA (10): Botswana, COMESA, Egypt, Israel*, Kenya, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia, South Africa,
       Tunisia, and Türkiye*.


Period

The OECD CompStats database contains eight years of annual data for the period 2015 to 2022.

Notes


1
  Budgets in real terms are calculated adjusting the values of nominal budgets by the inflation rate
presented in each jurisdiction each year.

2
  It needs to be noted that the UK and New Zealand have voluntary merger regimes, which implies that
those mergers that are notified are already more likely to be problematic. This is likely to affect the
percentage of notified mergers that is challenged by the competition authority.

3
 The European Commission takes part in the work of the OECD, in accordance with the Supplementary
Protocol to the Convention on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

OECD Competition Trends 2024
The 2024 edition of the OECD Competition Trends report highlights worldwide competition enforcement
trends during the calendar year 2022 based on 77 jurisdictions. Similar to previous editions, this year’s
report compares different geographic regions and identifies trends over time. Analyses focus on competition
authorities’ resources and their enforcement activity in cartels, abuse of dominance cases, mergers,
and advocacy activity. Moreover, this year’s edition includes a special chapter on merger control, which
provides for the first time a disaggregate analysis of the participating jurisdictions. It also contains an analysis
of all merger prohibition cases between 2015 and 2022.
